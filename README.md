# Ayni Finance

[Project in Taikai Buildathon 2023](https://taikai.network/ethargentina/hackathons/buildathon-2023/projects/cll644adx00f9ub01xs3xjrnb/idea)

## Description

### Problem

Latin America is one of the regions with the lowest levels of banking. Around 60% of the Latin American population is unbanked, with this number significantly higher in rural areas, reaching up to 20%. Moreover, 75% of rural areas in Latin America are dedicated to agriculture. Despite having assets that could serve as collateral, individuals involved in agriculture, such as small farmers, are often excluded from traditional financial systems.

### Why Ayni Finance?

Ayni Finance draws inspiration from Inca culture, which utilized a communal development model called "Ayni" instead of traditional banks. This model emphasized personal development contributing to communal progress.

### Solution

Ayni Finance is a platform that facilitates financial inclusion for rural, unbanked populations through asset tokenization, leveraging rural communities' customs and practices.

### Business Model

Ayni Finance earns a 20% share of the interest paid to investors. This percentage is added to the base interest rate suggested by Ayni Finance to rural community members wishing to tokenize their assets.

### Unique Features

Ayni Finance allows the tokenization of various assets with verifiable value, including movable assets (livestock, machinery, production) and immovable assets (partial or total land ownership). It also promotes decentralized credit scoring based on the applicant's reputation within the community, determined by decentralized community voting. For example, if applicant "A" seeks a loan collateralized by their livestock, their initial credit risk rating and approval depend on the trust votes they receive from their community.
